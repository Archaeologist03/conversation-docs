<a name="authentication"></a>
## Security and Authentication

You can authenticate requests with the Conversation API using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).

A JWT consists of a header, a payload and a signature in the structure xxxxx.yyyyy.zzzzz. The expected JWT structure is as follows prior to signing is:

```json
{
  "alg": "RS256", // The encryption algorithm used to generete the JWT. RS256 is supported.
  "typ": "JWT", // The media type of the JWT. JWT is supported.
  "iat": 1499960490, // The UNIX timestamp at UTC + 0 indicating the moment the JWT was issued.
  "jti": "bd620670-67e1-11e7-b2ab-39affcc8ac9c", // The unique ID of the JWT.
  "sub": "jamie", // Optional. The name for the User you are trying to authenticate.
  "exp": "1500046889", // Optional. The UNIX timestamp at UTC + 0 indicating the moment the JWT is no longer valid. Default to 15 minutes from the time the JWT was issued.
  "acl": {  // Access control list
    "paths": { // The API paths and related permissions that the JWT has
      "/v1/sessions/**": {},
      "/v1/users/**": {},
      "/v1/conversations/**": {}
    }
  },
  "application_id": "YOUR_APP_ID" // Your Nexmo application UUID
}
```

You must use HTTPS for all Nexmo API requests.

<a name="encoding"></a>
## Encoding

You need to submit all requests with a `POST`, `PUT` or `GET` HTTP request using UTF-8 encoding and URL encoded values. The expected `Content-Type` for `POST` or `PUT` should be `application/json`

<a name="conversations"></a>
## Conversations

You can use the following requests to create, read, update and delete Conversations:

* [POST `https://api.nexmo.com/beta/conversations`](#conversations_post) - create a Conversation
* [GET `https://api.nexmo.com/beta/conversations?`](#conversations_get_query) - query Conversations
* [GET `https://api.nexmo.com/beta/conversations/UUID`](#conversations_get_single) - get information about a single Conversation
* [PUT `https://api.nexmo.com/beta/conversations`](#conversations_post) - modify an existing conversation
* [DELETE `https://api.nexmo.com/beta/conversations`](#conversations_delete) - delete a conversation
